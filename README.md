# Black_Jack_Game 
This is a Python-based Blackjack game.The objective of the game is to beat the dealer, 
which can be done in the following ways:

1 . Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a blackjack), without a dealer blackjack;

2 . Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or

3 . Let the dealer draw additional cards until his or her hand exceeds 21.

Following rules are implemented for the dealer in the game.

1 . Dealer hits until his cards total 17 or more points.

2 . Dealer also hits on soft 17(i.e, when the dealer initial 2 card value is 17, eg. e.g., an initial ace and six).

3 . Dealer never split and double down.
